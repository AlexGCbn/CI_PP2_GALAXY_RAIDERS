                <h2>What is "GALAXY RAIDERS"?</h2>
                <p>
                    This game is a homage to the classic arcade game "Space Invaders", released in 1978 and originally
                    developed by Taito.
                    The page you are looking at has been created as a project, part of my studies. What I hope is that
                    the people that have played this as part of their childhood will be able to relive some memories,
                    and the people that play it for the first time will have a taste of what gaming meant in the
                    past.<br>
                    <br>
                    This page is in no case affiliated with the original game or the people that developed it. It is a
                    fan project that cannot be used commercially.<br>
                    <br>
                    Even though the core gameplay of the original game persists, some features have been changed.
                    The score is not calculated the same, there aren't any "lives" and no obstacles have been placed.
                    More differences can be found, as the version here is just a fan version.

                <h2>How to play:</h2>
                <p>
                    The gameplay is simple. You can move your ship left or right and shoot a rocket from it.<br>
                    The aliens will slowly move towards the bottom. Your goal is to stop them from doing that by
                    shooting all of them!<br>
                    If any of them reach the bottom, it is game over.
                    When you have shot all of them, the board is reset and your ship will shoot slightly faster. The
                    aliens will also move faster throughout the whole game, however.
