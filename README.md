Galaxy Raiders is a personal remake of the classic game "Space invaders". The intent of the project is to provide users with a representation of the game, along with some information about the game and the person who developed the page. It was intended to keep the game as close to the original as possible in terms of gameplay, yet there might be some key differences. Even so, the website strives to provide the user with a pleasant and fun way to pass time and maybe relive some childhood memories.
